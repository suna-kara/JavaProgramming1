 Exp 1: we will create a method that will return count of even numbers, and parameters is an int Array

  Exp 2= we will create a method that will return the difference  between max and min Array


Ex 3:This example was implemented to show that we can call a method from other methods

Exp 4:  Can I use a return of a method inside other method as of it's parameter

??  methodone(String str,int x) ?? public static int methodTwo(){}


PIQ: What is Method Overloading?

    str.substring(int beginningIndex)
    str.substring(int beginningIndex, int endingIndex)

    rules: method has to have same name, with different parameters(number of parameters)












  Wrapper Class:

  int,double,char,short....primitive

  Integer X=new Integer(9);  ------>value is just 9

  X is called object reference

  9 is the value of that object


  Since X is object reference;  I can reach methods of these Wrapper Classes

  Auto-boxing / Unboxing

  Ä°f JAVA compiler makes your primitive data type to corresponding object Wrapper class : Auto-boxing

  if it is opposite way it is called Unboxing


  ArrayList: Can I put primitive inside ArrayList? NO NO NO


  Data Structures:

  Arrays: Flexible size however it is slower comparing to Arrays

  Biggest advantages comes from

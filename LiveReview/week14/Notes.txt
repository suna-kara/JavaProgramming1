 Today's Topics:

             * We will try to imitate like we are testing Amazon Web Page Shopping Feature
             - Parent Class : Browser

    Overriding: When you need more speciliazed method for the child class
     you override the method in parent class
     exp: toString

     Rules: PIQ(Performance Intelligence Quotient)
     -there must be IS-A relationship
     -method names MUST be same (shopFor)
     - same parameter
     -access modifier should be same or more visible
     -Return type : for primitive it must be same,for object type has to
     be covariant

     What are the differences between Overloading and Overriding? PIQ

   Method Overloading
   Method Overriding
   Method Hiding(overriding the static methods)

  Ä°nheritance Types:
        Single Inheritance: class AmazonHomePage extends Browser
        Multi-level: class Product Page extendsclass AmazonHomePage
    extends Browser

        Hierarchical Inheritance: Product and Cart page extends AmazonHomePage

Multiple Inheritance?????? Not possible with regular JAVA classes(possible with Interfaces)

 Let's create a Test Case together:
 1. I need to set my browser  and OS type
 2.Navigate to APP's Page
 3. navigate to laptops and select Samsung PC
 4.

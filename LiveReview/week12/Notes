      methods for creating function

      Access Modifier specifier returnType methodName(){
           statement
      }


   Access Modifiers:
       * public ---> allows to reach from every other class or packages
       *private----> only inside the same class you can reach
       *default-----> OOP
       *protected----> OOP

  specifier : Static keyword, Final

  returnType : void or any Data type


  PIQ: What are the differences between Constructor and Methods:

      Constructor: special method,it is a MUST, it is used the create and(maybe)
      initializing  fiels of the object

             Access -Modifier ClassName(parameter){

             statement

             }


   Object: new ClassName();----> we are calling the constructor

   instance(multipl copies) variables or methods: each obj has it's own copy

   static(one copy): all the obj they have the same copy and share it



   asString()

   ************************************

   PIQ:

   this.   ------> İnstance obj values or methods
   this() ----> used for calling the constructor

   =========================================

   static methods can be called with calssname
   --Can I call static methods withobjects? yes


Static Methods VS İnstance Methods
  1. İnstance method can be only called by obj name
  2. Static methods CAN NOT reach non-static fields(attributes)

  ====================================================

  Static Blocks / Static İnitializer Block

  -----> code in the static block runs before everything else when loaded to the memory by Classloader
   we use it to initialize static fields
